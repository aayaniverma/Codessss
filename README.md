# Myntra-HackerRamp
<p>Visual 3D Trial for Clothes</p>
<p>This project utilizes computer vision and 3D modeling technologies to provide a virtual try-on experience for clothes.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Technologies Used:</p>
<p>-OpenCV: Used for real-time computer vision tasks, such as capturing video from a webcam and image processing.</p>
<p>-MediaPipe: Integrated for holistic body pose estimation and hand tracking.</p>
<p>-VR & AR: Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) techniques are employed for immersive visualization.</p>
<p>-Flask: Web framework utilized for developing the web application and serving it locally.</p>
<p>-MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing user data and preferences securely.</p>
<p>-Blender 3D Modeling: Employed for creating detailed 3D models of clothes for virtual try-on.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>1.Python Libraries</p>
<p>-Ensure you have Python installed on your system.</p>
<p>-Install necessary Python packages using pip</p>
<p>"pip install opencv-python mediapipe Flask pymongo"</p>
<p>2.Blender</p>
<p>Blender software should be installed for 3D modeling purposes.</p>
<p>Models created using Blender can be integrated into the virtual try-on experience.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Getting Started:</p>
