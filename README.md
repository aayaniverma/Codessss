# Myntra-HackerRamp
Visual 3D Trial for Clothes
This project utilizes computer vision and 3D modeling technologies to provide a virtual try-on experience for clothes.

Technologies Used:
-OpenCV: Used for real-time computer vision tasks, such as capturing video from a webcam and image processing.
-MediaPipe: Integrated for holistic body pose estimation and hand tracking.
-VR & AR: Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) techniques are employed for immersive visualization.
-Flask: Web framework utilized for developing the web application and serving it locally.
-MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing user data and preferences securely.
-Blender 3D Modeling: Employed for creating detailed 3D models of clothes for virtual try-on.

Requirements:
1.Python Libraries
-Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
-Install necessary Python packages using pip

2.Blender
Blender software should be installed for 3D modeling purposes.
Models created using Blender can be integrated into the virtual try-on experience.

Getting Started:
1.Clone this repository:
"git clone https://github.com/aayaniverma/Myntra-HackerRamp"
2.Install dependencies
3.Start the Flask application:
"python app.py"
4.Access the application locally in your web browser:
"http://localhost:5000/"

Usage:
-Upon running the application, navigate to the homepage.
-Use the virtual try-on feature to see clothes modeled in 3D using your webcam.
-Explore different garments and interact with the virtual environment.
